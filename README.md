## You wanna help? 

This repository will help people who don't know how to participate in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) or where to start contributing. We will be adding a Hacktoberfest label to help contributors find the issues they can contribute to. 

**DO NOT submit any pull request that does no fix based on an issue or an actual bug/fix, as it will be labeled invalid and will not count for your Hacktoberfest participation.**  


## How to help? 
If you want to create some pattern, please follow the examples.
