# Visitor Pattern

**_Visitor_** is a behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.

## Example:
Imagine a seasoned insurance agent who’s eager to get new customers. He can visit every building in a neighborhood, trying to sell insurance to everyone he meets. Depending on the type of organization that occupies the building, he can offer specialized insurance policies:
- If it’s a residential building, he sells medical insurance.
- If it’s a bank, he sells theft insurance.
- If it’s a coffee shop, he sells fire and flood insurance.
